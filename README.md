## Multi-Blockchain Wallet SDK Documentation

This SDK enables developers to seamlessly integrate a crypto deposit system into their applications by generating private keys and public addresses using a user's identity (e.g., email, UUID) and a developer-defined password. It supports Ethereum, Solana, and Tron, providing a versatile tool for managing blockchain transactions.

### Features

* Generate private keys and public addresses using a user's identity and a developer-defined password.
* Supports Ethereum, Solana, and Tron network.


### Use Case Summary

Developers can utilize this SDK to:

1. Create wallets with private keys derived from user identifiers and a secure password.
2. Share the public address with the user for deposit purposes.
3. Monitor these addresses to:
    * Verify deposits.
    * Update user balances accordingly.
4. Manage funds, including withdrawals, for a comprehensive crypto deposit system.

### Getting Started

1. Install the SDK (installation instructions to be added).
2. Use the `generateEvmPrivateKeyForUserIdentity` function with:
    * User's identity.
    * Developer's password.
    * Iterations.
    * key Length.
3. Provide the user with the public address for deposits.
4. Implement webhooks or a monitoring system to track transactions to the public address.
5. Update user balances upon successful deposits.
6. Manage withdrawals as needed.

**This approach ensures:**

* Secure transactions.
* User balance management.
* Full control over the funds by the developer.

**Note:** Replace "(installation instructions to be added)" with the actual installation instructions for your SDK.
